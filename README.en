functions:
create new linux services
auto start the services when starting a server
add daemon for the services


supported os(other OSes are not tested):
redhat 6.x
ubuntu 14.04

how to use:
you need to log in as "root", upload the directory to anywhere, and then execute the script create_service.sh.
create_service.sh name appbin appargs
name: name of the service
appbinï¼šthe command(this command should not contain space, and need full path)
appargs: parameters of the command(arguments with spaces between should be enclosed by quotes, and if there is no parameter, there should be two quotes)

All services created here have one daemon. 
By default, the daemon will check services once every minute, if a service is not running, the daemon will try at most 5 times to start it.
You can check log file /var/log/service_guard/service_guard.log for detailed stop/start information.
